# Introduction
James - Senior at Vanderbilt University studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics with an interest in Software Engineering and Quantitative Developer. 

Abdallah - Senior at Vanderbilt University studying Computer Science with an interest in Software Engineering and Quantitative Trading. 

Both individuals are learning how to create a C++ Low Latency Trading System. Both are beginning this personal project by learning the basic behind a trading system. Building-Low-Latency-Applications-with-CPP writen by PacktPublishing and low-latency-trading-system by n-saurino are both references utilized to assist with the learning process. 

# Current Status
We are writing code based on the book to assist us with the learning process. The idea is to create a low-latency trading system from scratch using the book's materials as a template reference.
